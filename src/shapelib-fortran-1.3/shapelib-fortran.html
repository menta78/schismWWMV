<h2>Shapelib-Fortran</h2>

This package contains Fortran 90/95 bindings to the <a
href="http://shapelib.maptools.org/">Shapefile C Library</a> for
accessing ESRI Shapefiles, a common format in Geographic Information
Systems for vector data.<p>

NOTICE: This package is not under active developent anymore, please
refer to the <a href="http://fortrangis.berlios.de/">FortranGIS</a>
project for a new and more complete Fortran interface to GIS libraries
using ISO_C_BINDING facilities of Fortran 2003.<p>

<h3>Download</h3>

The Shapelib-Fortran
package <a href="shapelib-fortran-1.3.tar.gz">version 1.3</a> can be
downloaded directly from this page.<br>

<hr>

<h3>Build</h3>

The package is configured with the standard GNU autotools, so, in the
simplest case, the building procedure consists in typing:
<pre>
./configure
make
make install
</pre>
Try <tt>configure --help</tt> for more options to the configure
script, for example for indicating a particular Fortran compiler.
Make sure that the shapelib package (including the development package
if you distribution has one) is installed and accessible before trying
to build the Fortran bindings.<p>

The package contains also a spec file so that you can quickly build a
rpm package, on a GNU/Linux system supporting rpm, just issuing the
command <tt>rpmbuild -ba &lt;package-name&gt;.tar.gz</tt>.<p>

Shapelib-fortran has been tested on Fedora 12 and Debian lenny
i386/x86_64 GNU/Linux systems. It has been successfully tested with
gfortran, g95 and pgf90 Fortran compilers.<p>

<h3>Use</h3>

In order to access the shapelib API from a Fortran program you have to
add

<pre>
USE shplib
</pre>

to your program unit.

The API has been kept as close as possible to the original C API; the
retrieved shapes are stored in a Fortran derived type
<tt>shpobject</tt> which mimics the C structure
<tt>SHPObject</tt>. Notice that the <tt>shpopen</tt> function, unlike
Fortran <tt>OPEN</tt> statement, requires the filename variable not to
contain trailing blanks unless this is explicitly wanted as a part of
the filename!, so the use of the Fortran intrinsinc function
<tt>TRIM()</tt> is suggested in this case.<p>

See shplib.f90 for the parameter and derived type definitions and
<a href="shp_read_test.f90">shp_read_test.f90</a> and
<a href="shp_write_test.f90">shp_write_test.f90</a> for an example.<p>

Be warned that the Fortran bindings do not support the DBF attribute
features of the C shapelib.<p>
