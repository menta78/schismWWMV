Fortran 90/95 bindings for shapelib (http://shapelib.maptools.org/)
Copyright (C) Davide Cesari, 2007, dcesari <at> arpa.emr.it
The sources are distributed according to the GNU LGPL license.

In order to access the shapelib API from fortran you have to add

USE shplib

to your program unit.

The API has been kept as close as possible to the original C API; the
retrieved shapes are stored in a Fortran derived type "shpobject"
which mimics the C structure "SHPObject". Notice that the shpopen
function, unlike Fortran OPEN statement, requires the filename
variable not to contain trailing blanks (unless this is
explicitly wanted!) otherwise the blanks are included in the filename.

See shplib.f90 for the parameter and derived type definitions and
shp_test.f90 for an example.

Be warned that the bindings need further testing, and may contain
bugs. They have been tested with gfortran, g95 and pgf90 compilers on
Linux.

Questions concerning the shapelib fortran bindings should be addressed
to Davide Cesari (dcesari <at> arpa.emr.it), other questions
concerning shapelib should be addressed to the maintainer of the
library, Frank Warmerdam (see web page).
