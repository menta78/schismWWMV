# The next line depends perhaps too much on the order of operations -- I'll try to fix it so that it is more intuitive.
# 1. hydro was added to selfemodlibs at PARENT_SCOPE so the local copy doesn't include hydro
# 2. hydro is added last except for core, so that all the modules that were used got here.
