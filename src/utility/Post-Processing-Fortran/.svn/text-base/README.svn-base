Post-processing API library based on FORTRAN

(1) extract_mod.f90: data structure and I/O routines used for extraction;
(2) extract_timeseries.f90: extract time series at given points (including vertical transects);
(3) extract_xyzt.f90: extract results at specifid (x,y,z,t) or (x,y,t) points.
                      The field examples for these 2 options are glider or CTD casts.
(4) extract_slab.f90: extract results at all grid nodes along a horizontal slab,
                      either at a fixed z or a fixed distance from free surface, or
                      along a S level (e.g., free surface and bottom); 
(5) *.sample: sample station input files for extraction scripts in this directory;
(6) compute_zcor.f90: a stand-alone routine that shows how to compute z coordinates in SELFE.

Use Makefile to compile 3 programs in (2-4).

------------------------------------------------------------
Python wrappers:

Makefile.py contains f2py command for generating .so and wrapper (with full 
debugging turned on).

read_stations.py gives an example python script for reading a transect 
or single depth stations, and generates an example image from that.

There is a single pair of lines (defining the the set of points to use) 
that needs to be switched which one is commented out to change the 
script from doing a profiles or single depth stations. I also include 
the line to read the stations from your sample file (commented out).


------------------------------------------------------------
More/: more FORTRAN extraction scripts that developers use for more advanced users.
       These scripts share similar strutures and can be modified for your own purpose
       once you understand the code.
(1) change_hotstart*: useful for generating your own hotstart.in;
(2) explain_output_format.f90: a simple code to flesh out the binary output structure;
(3) read_output7b_group_z2.f90, read_output7b_group_zfs2.f90: extract time series at
    a series of points in 2D/3D; in the case of 3D, z-coordinates specified can be
    relative to either a fixed datum or free surface.
(4) read_output7b_xyt.f90: extract entire vertical profiles (for 3D variables) at a 
    series of points (e.g. CTD casts);
(5) read_output7b_xyzt.f90: extract series at specified (x,y,z,t) (e.g. flow-thru survey);
(6) read_output7b_transect.f90: extract time series of 3D variable along a vertical
    transect.
