One way nesting scripts for serial and MPI SELFE.

The purpose is to generate elev2D.th, salt3D,th, temp3D.th and/or
 uv3D.th from a large-domain run to be used in a small-domain run. 

(1) use interpolate_variables*.f90 to generate *3D.th for the small-domain run;
(2)* [this is not necessary after R1693] if a different time step is needed for the small-domain run, 
    use timeint_3Dth2.f90 to interpolate in time to generate new *3D.th.
(3) use the new *3D.th for the small-domain run.

*.in are sample inputs for these scripts.
