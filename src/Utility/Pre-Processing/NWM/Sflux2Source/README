Recommended usage:
  run scripts in the current dir and set the schism run dir inside the scripts.

sflux2source.m:
  convert precipitation in sflux to source, see usage in the beginning of the script

merge_source_sink.m:
  Merge two sets of source/sink files:
    <Original source/sink>
      source_sink.in.1
      vsource.th.1
      msource.th.1
      vsink.th.1
    <source/sink converted from sflux>
      source_sink.in.2
      vsource.th.2
      msource.th.2
      (no sinks, because evaporation is not included)
  See usage in the beginning of the script.
  This script takes much memory if the grid is big. If matlab is "Killed" for memory issues, run it in an interactive session on Sciclone.
  You can get more memory by requesting all cores on one node instead of one single core, e.g. on Vortex: qlogin -q matlab -t 1080 1:vortex:compute:ppn=12
