Developer's notes:

(1) Download the tar balls and retrieve the source code, utility code, libraries, and two simple tests;
(2) study Makefile;
(3) build graph partitioning library ParMetis - follow instruction inside;
(4) make executible;
(5) repeat the two sample tests: (a) adjust_test.tar.gz (Adjustment under gravity); 
    (b) biotoy test (biotoy.tar.gz) for coupling with EcoSim. 

About the source code: 
(1) all serial code options (and more) are now available in MPI code;
(2) Input files: the main differences between serial and MPI version are in param.in, hotstart.in 
    and nudging inputs for S,T. Note that param.in now uses a free format; see user manual for details.

How to run:

Remember to make a subdirectory inside the run directory called 'outputs/'
where all process-specific outputs are stored.

On Intel, 

mpiexec -n 24 pelfe

Ask your system manager if your system is different.

Postprocessing:

Currently each process will spit out results
 within its own subdomain, and the code combine_output*.f90 insde utility/
 can be used to gather these files
 into one global output. You may use the simple perl script autocombine_MPI_elfe.pl to do the combining automatically. 

Most outputs are process-specific also. This is the case for hotstart outputs, 
and so in order to hotstart, you need to combine outputs into one hotstart.in
 using combine_hotstart3.f90 in utility/.

Notes about WWM:
(1) right now SMETHOD=3 is very slow; use SMETHOD=1;
