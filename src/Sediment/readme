In order of ionvocation in Hydro code:

sed_mod - parameters for sediment model

read_sed_input - subroutine to read the sediment model inputs written in sediment.in file; optionally
                 calculate settling vel and critical shear stress;

sed_init.-subroutine to set initial conditions for sediment tracer fields and initial bed conditions

sediment - routine to compute the sediment source and sinks. It includes the vertical settling of 
           the sediment, erosional and depositional flux, transport of multiple grain sizes, bedload 
           based on Meyer Peter and Mueller (not active yet) or van Rijn. Morphological model is found inside.
           Vertical settling is handled with semi-Lagrangian PPM and eventually cast into a body force for
           the transport solver.

sed_bedload - bedload routines (including call to solve_jcg() for morphol. model)

sed_friction - bottom formulations

sed_filter - morphological filters

sed_misc_subs - misc routines
