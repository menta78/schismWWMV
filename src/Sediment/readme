Makefile - makefile to compile the code. In lines below the text "specify different enviroment and/or preprocessing options" we have to active the options that we want to turn active (if you want to run the model with suspended sediment active turn on option SUSPENDED) 


elfe_main_V8.F90 - SELFE source code with sediment module included, all the inclusions are marked with the leters LLP or pre-proceced in C and identified with #USE_SED.

sediment_v8.f90 - routine to compute the sediment source and sinks. It includes the vertical settling of the sediment, erosional and depositional flux, transport of multiple grain sizes, bedload based on Meyer Peter and Mueller (BEDLOAD_MP) or van Rijn (BEDLOAD_VR). The part of the code related with the waves is not implemented and the code is the original(#BBL_MODEL,#BEDLOAD_SOULSBY). 

sed_init.f90 -subroutine to set initial conditions for sediment tracer fields and initial bed conditions

ini_sed.f90 - initialize several variables in the module sed_mod

sed_mod.f90, sed_param.f90, ocean_mod.f90 - parameters for sediment model

set_vbc.f90 - this module sets vertical boundary conditions for tracers (options UV_LOGDRAG, UV_QDRAG, UV_LDRAG)

stress_soulsby.f90 - compute bottom stress and tauc to use in the Meyer Peter and Muller formulation

read_sed_input.f90  -subroutine to read the sediment model inputs written in sediment.in file

My notes:

(1) options not implemented: BBL_MODEL, BEDLOAD_SOULSBY
