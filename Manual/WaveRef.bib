Abstract = {{The physics of wind input in the Wave Ocean Model (AA): cycle 4 is based
   on scaling with the friction velocity u({*}). This implies that in the
   case of fetch-limited,wind-wave growth, universal scaling laws should
   follow if fetch and wave variance are scaled by means of u({*}). For
   operational applications, such as at the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the scaling of the WAM model with u({*})
   is well satisfied. Recently, however, it was found that this scaling is
   violated for very short: waves at small fetches and durations, for which
   the model is run with very small grid spacings, a very small time step,
   and a large cutoff frequency. This violation of u({*}), scaling, which
   is a serious problem for implementation on a small lake, was found to be
   caused by a too severe limit on the increments of the wave spectrum per
   time step. In this article, an alternative formulation for,the
   limitation of spectral component growth is-suggested, which does not
   violate u({*}) scaling and, in addition, gives rise to excellent results
   over a large range of scaled quantities. At the same time, growth curves
   for wave height and peak frequency hardly depend on the time step.}},

Abstract = {{New parameterizations for the spectral dissipation of wind-generated
   waves are proposed. The rates of dissipation have no predetermined
   spectral shapes and are functions of the wave spectrum and wind speed
   and direction, in a way consistent with observations of wave breaking
   and swell dissipation properties. Namely, the swell dissipation is
   nonlinear and proportional to the swell steepness, and dissipation due
   to wave breaking is nonzero only when a nondimensional spectrum exceeds
   the threshold at which waves are observed to start breaking. An
   additional source of short-wave dissipation is introduced to represent
   the dissipation of short waves due to longer breaking waves. A reduction
   of the wind-wave generation of short waves is meant to account for the
   momentum flux absorbed by longer waves. These parameterizations are
   combined and calibrated with the discrete interaction approximation for
   the nonlinear interactions. Parameters are adjusted to reproduce
   observed shapes of directional wave spectra, and the variability of
   spectral moments with wind speed and wave height. The wave energy
   balance is verified in a wide range of conditions and scales, from the
   global ocean to coastal settings. Wave height, peak and mean periods,
   and spectral data are validated using in situ and remote sensing data.
   Some systematic defects are still present, but, overall, the
   parameterizations probably yield the most accurate estimates of wave
   parameters to date. Perspectives for further improvement are also given.}},
